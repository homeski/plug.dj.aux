# plug.dj.aux

**plug.dj.aux** is a minimal chrome extension to improve the plug.dj user experience.

Simply add it to your bookmarks bar and click it when you enter a room. It'll add some neat features to make your life easier! 

## What functionality does it add?

* Press `spacebar` to mute/unmute the audio as long as you are not typing into an input (e.g. while chatting).
* All songs played will automatically be auto-wooted

## How do I use it? 

1. Add a new bookmark to chrome named whatever you like and copy, paste this as the url: 

```js
javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/homeski/plug.dj.aux/master/plug.dj.aux.js');}());
```

2. Click the bookmark when you enter a plug.dj chatroom.
3. That's it!
